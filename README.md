If you have found this repository because you are looking for solutions to homework, then you have succeeded and you are welcome to learn from my implementations. However, without actual knowledge of why something is being done, you only hurt yourself.

With that being said, read my code, read the comments, understand why something happens, and then build your own implementation. Good luck on your projects!
